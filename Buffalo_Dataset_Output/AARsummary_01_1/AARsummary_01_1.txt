Economy DOOMS P. A Housing-AID HOPES
With most of it's employees leving a long commute
Away, Palo Alto had hoped to increase the availability
of financial assistance so more city employees could
love in this exorbitantly priced community. Those hapes,
however, have been doshed by the desmal economy.
Strapped for funds, the city has concluded it
can afford only to offer greater housing incentives to
the top echelon at City Hall.
Currently, housing assistance is available to the four
Council -appointed officers the city check, auditor, attorney
and manager.
But under a new proposal backed by the councels
policey Committee, some new housing benefits could be
extended selectively to all department heads and to the
assistant city manager Among the benefits that could
be made more widely available are location costs,
Mortgage locens and rental subsidies of up to $500 a month
for 36 months
The extended housing program probably would be
fiended by city reserviss, accading to a staff report.
