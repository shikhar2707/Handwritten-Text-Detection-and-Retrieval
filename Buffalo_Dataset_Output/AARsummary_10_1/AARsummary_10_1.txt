PLAN DELAYED FOR BA Y-TO-COAST
TRAIL
U much-anticipated trail that would line nugged
natural sites from the bay to the coast may loom
on the horizon. But the be bureautuatic pash leading
to its creation may have just gotten a little longer.
Palo Alto and the Med-Peninsula Regional Open
Space District had planned to apply by the end of
the year for a $75,000 state grant to fund half the
project. The remaining $ 45,000 needed would be splet
between the city and the distic.
But now, Palo Alto City Manager William Zane
has recommended that the city not apply for the grant
lentil 1992 because of several concerns about the project.
Representatives of the open space destruct were disappointed
by the news. But they said postponing the grant application
until next year shouldn't significantly delay the planned
4.5-mile regional trail that would begin at the base of
the 428-acre Crastradero Open Space Presence, then
Wind Douth along the perimeter of the 1,4000 1,400-
are Toothells Park before extending into the open
Space distreats 7,000 acres and into Santa Cruz County.
