HALF A Ce ENTURY on CHRISTMAS TREE LANE
Twas two Saturdays before Christmas, and plenty
of creatures were stiring in the Adamus family.
It was the day that the falks on fulton Street
turned their Palo Alto neighborhood into Chistmas Tree
Lone. But on Saturday morning, they first gathered

1940, without fail, residents on the 1700 and 1800

Christmas trees and nativity somes and Santas and

of leghted Secuations that line the normally quiet
residential stuet.
