P.A PROTESTS GREET YMCA'S
EXPANSION PLAN
In a scene reminiscent of the ongoing battle over
the expansion of the downtown Palo Alto medical Cline,
the city counce held a quarrelsome thee hacer
public hearing. Tuesday night that could have been
titled "YM CA. The sequel !
Like the medical clines, the application by the YMCA
to more than double the size of its facilities on Ross
Road in South Palo Alto pits a non-profit agencey that
senes a Citywide constituency against it's immediate
neighbous.
We had haped to enjoy aur senset years in the peace
and tranquillity of an R.(single - family residential ) neighborhood,
said Bob Gurney, who lives with his wife on Stone Lane
around the corner from the YMCA. "But this will not
be the case because of the increased traffe."
Gurney was among 52 people who signed up to
address the council, which adyoumed at midnight without
making a decision on the expansion plans. The Concil,
Which will take up the issue again Monday is hoping
to avoid the bitterness of the fight over the expansion of the
medical Clinic, which will be decaded by votes in a referenden nest July
