BY NEXT JULY BOARD WILL VOTE on
PROPOSAL FUNDED BY County
Smoking would be banned in Palo Alto Schools
starting in July under a policy expected to be approved
this week.
The ante - tobacco plan, which would be enforced in
School disstrect buildings and vehicles, con field trips and
during other school -sponsood events off campers, would
also provide for free stap -smoking classes for employees.
Palo Alto Uniqued School District trustees are scheduled
to vote on the proposal at their meeting Tuesday.
"I think the community is behind it, and I think,
educationally, the district is behind it," said Diane Wieder,
the districts Special programos condenator. The PTA and
employee union leaders have endrased it, she added.
Besides its obvious health benefits to smokers and non-
Smothers who inhale secondhand smoke, the ban is important
because non-smoking adults are good role models for Chilchen.
