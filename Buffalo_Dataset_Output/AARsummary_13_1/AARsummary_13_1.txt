A SHARK, LEARN ALOT
ONE DOESN'T have to go swemming with
the fishes to pet a living shack not at the Palo
Alto duention Meuseum, anyway. This Saturday the
Museum kicks off a new exhibit called "Water of Life".
And for the opening reception, the Marine Saince Institute
is bringing in its traveling salt-water tank that contains
a shack. The Cheildren then get to get this cousin of fans.
It's not going to be some fearful creature of the deep,
though. It's just going to be two, three feet," said
Museum deoctor John Walton, "Certainly not a beg monster."
Still, Kids will get to touch and feel Shark skin.
(haspy like a cat tongue, Walton said.)
The share petting you will be around just for a
few hours on Saturday, from 1 to 4p.m During those
hours, the shark will be joined by the Whale Bus,
a traveling museum that features whale bones and tons
of information about the Earth's largest animal.
